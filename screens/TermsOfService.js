            <Text style={styles.text}>
                This website is owned and controlled by RECKITonline, a Ghanaian Company. This Agreement and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of GHANA. You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in GHANA and stipulate to the fairness and convenience of proceedings in such courts for all disputes, both contractual and non-contractual, arising out of or relating to the use of the Services by you or any third party. You agree that all claims you may have against RECKITonline arising from or relating to the Services must be heard and resolved in a court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in GHANA. Use of the Services is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these terms and conditions, including, without limitation, this paragraph. Nothing in this clause shall limit the right of RECKITonline to take proceedings against you in any other court, or courts, of competent jurisdiction. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent that applicable law in your country of residence requires application of another law and/or jurisdiction – in particular, if you are using the Services as a consumer - and this cannot be excluded by contract and will not be governed by the United Nations Conventions on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, if otherwise applicable.
